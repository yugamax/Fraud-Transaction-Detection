## 📖 Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions within the Ethereum blockchain. By leveraging machine learning techniques, it aims to identify and flag suspicious activities, enhancing the security and integrity of blockchain-based financial systems.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

* 📁 **`dataset/`**: Contains the datasets used for training and evaluating the fraud detection models.
* 🤖 **`model/`**: Stores the trained machine learning models and related artifacts.
* ⚙️ **`.github/workflows/`**: Includes GitHub Actions workflows for continuous integration and deployment.
* 🔌 **`api_connect.py`**: Script to connect and interact with the Ethereum network or APIs.
* 🔁 **`retrain_model.py`**: Script to retrain the machine learning model with new data.
* 📄 **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all Python dependencies required to run the project.
* 📝 **`README.md`**: Provides an overview and documentation of the project.

## 💾 Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yugamax/Fraud-Transaction-Detection.git
   cd Fraud-Transaction-Detection
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Connecting to the Ethereum Network**:

   * Use `api_connect.py` to establish a connection with the Ethereum blockchain. Ensure you have the necessary API keys or node access.

2. **Retraining the Model**:

   * To retrain the model with updated data:

     ```bash
     python retrain_model.py
     ```

3. **Detecting Fraudulent Transactions**:

   * Once the model is trained, integrate it into your transaction processing pipeline to flag suspicious activities.

*Note*: Specific implementation details, such as data preprocessing steps, model architecture, and evaluation metrics, are not provided in the repository. Users may need to customize these components based on their specific requirements.
